# Prestige Hotel Reservation - Deployment Architecture

This repository contains the architecture diagram for the Prestige Hotel Reservation system for Spring 2025, TED University.

## How to View the Diagram

The architecture diagram is created using Mermaid, a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create diagrams.

You can view the diagram in any of the following ways:

1. **GitHub:** If you're viewing this on GitHub, the Mermaid diagram in `prestige_hotel_architecture.md` should render automatically.

2. **VS Code:** Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension to view the diagram directly in VS Code.

3. **Mermaid Live Editor:** Copy the Mermaid code from `prestige_hotel_architecture.md` and paste it into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) to view and modify the diagram.

4. **Other Markdown editors:** Many modern Markdown editors support Mermaid diagrams natively.
